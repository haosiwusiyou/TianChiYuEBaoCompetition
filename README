File Structure:
the whole project including three folder, i.e. data(used to save input data), R(used to save R source code), result(used to save output result). Here is the details about R folder:
tianchi.allone.R: It is the main function in this project, you can only run this code, and then you can find the final result in result folder.
tianchi.configuration.R: It used to configure the basic parameters for this project
tianchi.feature.engineering.R: It is the function used for feature engineering.
tianchi.feature.selection.R: It is the function used for feature selection.
tianchi.forecast.R: It is the collection of massive methods to train data.
tianchi.postprocess.R: It is the function used to do model validation
tianchi.validation.R: It is the specific methods to value the model accuracy
tianchi.utils.R: Some util function for this project
Run:
setwd to the project root directory.
